No. I am not a photographer. It's a joke.

Anyway, I got me an Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III a few weeks ago. Took me a few years.

I've always wanted to do street photography but I didn't think I'd do great with just a mobile phone.

And here we are, few weeks after I got my camera, I still haven't done any street photography.

_Bummer_
