I've been dying to start writing! I stopped writing years ago because I was too lazy to write.

And now, I end up with a new blog with nothing to write.

...

Maybe I should just talk about how I set up this site? This can be a good start.

I was in a bit of dilemma on ho to set up a new blog. At first, I thought it would be good if I just develop a new Ruby on Rails from scratch. Phew, I'm glad I didn't do that! To me, it was an obvious choice because all I need is a blogging site. Why would I want to spin up a server for that? Seems overkill.

So, I look around looking for alternatives to Wordpress and Blogger. Why these two? These are the only blogging sites I'm used to. That's why.

And suddenly it came to me: why am I not considering GitHub Pages? It should be easy. I've known GitHub Pages for years. I've used it once. And I'm pretty sure the performance is way better than whatever servers I can afford right now.

While reading the instruction on how to set it up, I found out that GitHub and Jekyll are actually good *friends*. I've read about Jekyll a few times. Never considered it simply because it is used to serve static content (correct me if I'm wrong).

So, I did some readings and decided that I should just do it.

And here it is. My new blog. I really hope this will help me write more (and hopefully better) stuffs.
