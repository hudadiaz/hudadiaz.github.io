title: KamusKita Embedded
---

I added an embedding functionality to **Kamus**Kita so people can easily embed words in their website. I was inspired by Twitter and Facebook embedding functionality. It makes it convinient to directly present the word to your readers without having them to go to **Kamus**Kita themselves. As an example, the following is an embed taken from **Kamus**Kita:

<iframe src='https://kamuskita.my/w/donedakwah/def/40/embed' width='500' height='307.8' style='border:none;overflow:hidden' scrolling='no' frameborder='0' allowTransparency='true'></iframe>

As you can see, it's simple and straight forward. While setting it up requires a minute work, the fun makes it worth it.

I'm looking forward to make an image generator function so people can share words and definitions as image instead of links and pages.
