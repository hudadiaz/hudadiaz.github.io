I moved my DNS management to [Cloudflare](cloudflare.com) from [GoDaddy](godaddy.com) yesterday!

Actually, I did before but came back to GoDaddy because URL forwarding isn't that straight forward on Cloudflare. Nevertheless, Cloudflare looks much more appealing and trustworthy compared to GoDaddy I'll transfer out my domain next time!

I also changed my GitHub Pages domain to [zaidhuda.com](zaidhuda.com). I removed the **www** if you don't know what happens.
