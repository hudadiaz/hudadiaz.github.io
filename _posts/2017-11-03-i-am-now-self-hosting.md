title: I am now self hosting!
---

I met my geekest friend a few days back and he showed me how he's running Docker containers on his VPS to serve apps. Now that's neat, I thought. And guess what I did next? Yeah, you guessed it right, I set up my own VPS on Vultr.

That's it. From abusing gh-pages to self-hosting. Pretty neat eh

If you ask me, even I couldn't answer why I only set up my own VPS now instead of like 5 years ago
