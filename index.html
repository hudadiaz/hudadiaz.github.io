  <h2>About me</h2>
 Â <p>I am a programmer. I currently work for NetByteSec. I also do freelance stuffs whenever I feel like it. I am also working on <span class="kamuskita"><strong>Kamus</strong>Kita</span></p>

  <h2>Motto</h2>
  <blockquote>Things can be learned.</blockquote>
  <p>I believe that things can be learned no matter how hard it is. Though, not everything can be mastered. Life is not easy, sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you only get what you need. Other times, you just have to suck it up.</p>

  <h2>What I do</h2>

  <h3>Programming</h3>
  <p>I like programming. I especially like trying out new things. I'm easily excited to new things, and sadly get bored to it quickly. That's the one thing I need to work on.</p>

  <h3>Socializing</h3>
  <p>I believe as human we need to socialize. Ironically, I also believe I am an introvert. So, I am trying really hard to love people.</p>
  <p>I do have some people I care really much.</p>

  <h3>Fantasizing</h3>
  <p>I am not a dreamer. But that doesn't mean I don't fantasize. Wait, maybe I am not a dreamer because I don't try to make my fantasies a reality?</p>

  <h3>Dota 2</h3>
  <p>I play Dota 2. I hate 7!</p>

  <h2>My passion</h2>
  <p>I don't know what I live for. I love my family and friends, though. At the very least, I want to make them proud having to <em>know</em> me.</p>
